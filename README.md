# LaravelPayments
<p>This is a payments processing system, using the most popular payment platforms available.</p>
<p>We are going to be dealing with PayPal and Stripe but we will also configure the app such that any other payment platform can be easily added to it.</p>
<p>In the frontend we use HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, and Bootstrap5</p>
<p>For the database, we used Sqlite</p>
<p>Below are some screenshots of the project.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
